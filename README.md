The Tile Slider Game

Â© Copyright 2021 by Erick Levy

This is a remake of an old simple game coded first in Java for Android, and ported to HTML5, CSS3 and Javacript for my web skills test area.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about and play with this little app.

How to Play

The goal of this game is to PUT IN ORDER all the tiles.

You can only move the pieces to the only available space.
The game will end when all the pieces are arranged.
Try to do it in the shortest possible time!

Some of the frontend elements used in this little project:
* HTML5 semantic web tags
* Javascript referencing and manipulation of DOM elements
* CSS3 flex displaying and distribution
* Custom modal windows for alerts and dialogs
* Javascript image manipulation and sound playing
* Dynamic CSS class assignment
* Using local storage to save game settings and statistics
* Javascript collections, event listeners, timers, lambdas
* And so on...
